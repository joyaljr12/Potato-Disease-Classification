# Potato Disease Classification

### Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the "plantvillage" dataset to recognize and categorize plant types, which can aid in agricultural diagnostics, specifically identifying potato plants and their health status.

### Prerequisites
 * Python 3.x
 * TensorFlow
 * Keras
 * Matplotlib
 * NumPy
 
### Dataset
The model uses images from the "plantvillage" dataset, which contains a variety of labeled plant images.
Images are processed to have a consistent size of 256x256 pixels, and the dataset is divided into batches for efficient model training.
