#Potato Disease Clasiification


This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the "plantvillage" dataset to recognize and categorize plant types, which can aid in agricultural diagnostics, specifically identifying potato plants and their health status.
